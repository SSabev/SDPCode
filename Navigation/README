This is the navigation module which gets a the robot's coordinates and the coordinates of where it is supposed to go.
It breaks down into two(for now) modules:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute:
Computes the distance to the point the robot is supposed to go and the angle by which to turn.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Movement:
Translates the computations from Compute in order to give commands for wheel speed in order to get into the right position.
