Arduino sends the message every second:
"Press 1 to turn Arduino pin 13 LED ON or 0 to turn it OFF:"
and increments counter

every 8 seconds it also sends following message:
"Arduino counter: <counter value>\n"

Every second it checks for any incoming data.  If there is,
we read 1 byte.
If it is '1', led is ON
If it is '0', led is OFF

On PC we use non-blocking socket associated with BT connection.
It wakes up on available data - every second.
It recives multiple data packages per second (8 packages).
Every 8 packages we send the led byte and alter its value.
Thus the led is changing state every second.

Arduino MAC address is hardcoded.  PIN for the Arduino is 1234 (it is fixed).

To compule PC code:
gcc −o btcomm main.cpp −lbluetooth
