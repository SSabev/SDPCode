How to use thresholds selection
	The threshold selection uses user-specified pixels of the object to 
	find the smallest threshold range that contains all those pixels.

	Key commands:
	p: display the current pixel in HSV
	o: use the current pixel to update the temporary threshold
	i: apply the temporary threshold
	u: reset the temporary threshold

	current pixel = the pixel at the upper-left point of the mouse
