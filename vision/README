How to use thresholds selection
The threshold selection uses user-specified pixels of the object to 
find the smallest threshold range that contains all those pixels.

Key commands:
p: display the current pixel in HSV
o: use the current pixel to update the temporary threshold
i: apply the temporary threshold
u: reset the temporary threshold

current pixel = the pixel at the upper-left point of the mouse
